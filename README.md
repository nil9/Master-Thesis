# Master-Thesis
In this thesis, we present a graph-based scalable and novel approach for the recommendation which doesnâ€™t depend on the profile data for predictions. We evaluate our method on an extensive transaction dataset from the retail domain (700k transactions with 150k different items) and compare it to a baseline. The proposed approach relies on knowledge graph embeddings. During our evaluation, we have used two knowledge graph embedding algorithms. The suggested method first applies Pyke, a knowledge graph embedding algorithm with a close to linear runtime complexity. Later Pyke was replaced by a convolutional complex knowledge graph embedding algorithm, Conex. The evaluation results suggest that Conex fits better than Pyke to the approach.
