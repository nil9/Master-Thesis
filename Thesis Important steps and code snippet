1. Run the xml parsing code
2. Collect the result and convert into linix files
3. Trim the blanks from each of the collected triple stores
4. Save all the files from multiple subfolders to a specific folder

Below are the coodes snippet which I have used:


2. Collect the result and convert into linix files:

find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 -P 4 dos2unix  : This will pass 1 file at a time, and use 4 processors.


3. Trim the blanks from each of the collected triple stores:

find /media/sami/70AE0846AE080776/Deleteblank_Experiment/input -type f -name '*.nt' > filename.txt    # Here folder location is given which search for all .nt files and stores it in filename text file
for f in `cat filename.txt`
do
  sed -r -i 's/^\s*(.*\S)*\s*$/\1/;/^$/d' $f                                                          #  This trims the blanks inside the file location
done


4. Save all the files from multiple subfolders to a specific folder :

find ./input -name '*.nt' -exec mv {} /media/sami/70AE0846AE080776/folder2 \;   This is a shell script command first parameter : source folder location (Here we search for all .nt files).
Second parameter: destination folder location
